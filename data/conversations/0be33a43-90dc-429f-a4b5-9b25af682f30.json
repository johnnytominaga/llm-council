How many adults/kids?\n\n2. **Dietary stuff?**  \n   - Any vegetarians, vegans, halal/kosher, gluten-free, allergies?\n\n3. **Toppings you like / hate?**  \n   - Love: e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, spicy stuff, extra cheese  \n   - Hate: anything you absolutely won’t eat?\n\n4. **Crust & style preference:**  \n   - Thin / regular / deep dish / stuffed crust?  \n   - Classic (Domino’s/Pizza Hut style), Neapolitan-style, New York-style, etc.?\n\n5. **Budget & place:**  \n   - Ordering from a big chain or a local place?  \n   - Rough budget per person?\n\nIf you just want a quick, safe, “don’t overthink it” option for 1–3 people and no restrictions:\n- **One pizza:** Large half **pepperoni & mushroom**, half **margherita** on **regular crust**.  \nThat combination hits meat-eater + simple-cheese-lover preferences and is pretty universally liked.\n\nTell me those answers and I’ll give you a specific order (size, crust, toppings, and even which sides to add)."

          "response": "To give you the perfect recommendation, I need to know a little bit about your current \"pizza mood.\"\n\nHere is a breakdown to help you decide based on your vibe:\n\n### 1. The \"I just want a classic\" (Safe Bets)\n*   **The Pepperoni:** It is the most popular pizza for a reason. Salty, savory, slight kick of spice, and greasy in the best way.\n*   **The Plain Cheese:** Underrated. If you are ordering from a high-quality place (like a NY-style shop), a plain cheese lets the crust and sauce shine.\n\n### 2. The \"I’m starving and want maximum value\" (The Heavy Hitters)\n*   **The Meat Lovers:** Pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon. If you want to fall into a food coma immediately after eating, this is the one.\n*   **The Supreme/The Works:** You get the meat, but the peppers, onions, and olives add crunch and cut through the grease. It feels like a complete meal.\n\n### 3. The \"I want to feel a little fancy\" (The Gourmet)\n*   **Margherita:** Fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce. It’s light, fresh, and doesn't leave you feeling heavy.\n*   **White Pizza (Pizza Bianca):** No tomato sauce. Usually garlic, ricotta, mozzarella, and maybe some spinach. It’s creamy and rich.\n*   **Prosciutto & Arugula:** Usually served with a balsamic glaze. It feels sophisticated.\n\n### 4. The \"I want something different\" ( The Wildcards)\n*   **BBQ Chicken:** Sweet BBQ sauce base instead of tomato, chicken, onions, and sometimes cilantro. It’s a totally different flavor profile.\n*   **Buffalo Chicken:** If you like spicy wings, this is the way to go. Usually has a ranch or blue cheese drizzle.\n*   **The Hawaiian:** Ham and Pineapple. The sweet and salty combo is actually delicious, despite what the internet says.\n\n---\n\n### Still can't decide? Let's play \"Pizza Roulette\":\n\n**Ask yourself these three questions:**\n1.  **Do you eat meat?** (No = Veggie Supreme; Yes = Go to Q2)\n2.  **Do you want spicy?** (Yes = Diavola/Jalapeño; No = Go to Q3)\n3.  **Do you want to regret how much you ate later?** (Yes = Meat Lovers; No = Pepperoni or Mushroom).\n\n**If you tell me what you usually like or where you are ordering from (Domino's, Papa Johns, or a local Italian spot), I can give you a specific order!**"

Pizza choices depend on what you're craving—classic, adventurous, vegetarian, meaty, or something else? Here's a quick guide based on popular options from places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, or your local spot:\n\n### If you're in the mood for...\n- **Classic and Reliable**: Go with a Margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil). Simple, fresh, and hard to mess up. Add some extra cheese if you're feeling indulgent.\n- **Meaty Feast**: Pepperoni or Meat Lovers (loaded with sausage, pepperoni, ham, beef, etc.). Perfect for carnivores or a game night.\n- **Veggie Vibes**: A Vegetarian Supreme (bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes). Great if you're watching calories or going plant-based—add spinach or artichokes for extra flair.\n- **Adventurous Twist**: Hawaiian (ham and pineapple) for that sweet-savory combo, or BBQ Chicken for something smoky and tangy.\n- **Spicy Kick**: Buffalo Chicken or a Jalapeño Popper pizza if you like heat.\n\nPro tips:\n- Crust: Thin for crispy, stuffed for cheesy goodness, or gluten-free if needed.\n- Size: Personal if solo, large if sharing.\n- Sides: Don't forget garlic bread or wings!\n\nWhat are your favorite toppings, any dietary prefs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), or where you're ordering from? That'll help me refine this! 🍕"

          "ranking": "Response A  \n**What it does well:**\n- Clearly explains that more info is needed and asks very practical, structured questions (people count, dietary needs, toppings, crust, budget).\n- Offers a concrete, ready-to-use fallback: a large half pepperoni & mushroom / half margherita on regular crust. That directly answers “Which pizza should I order?” even without more input.\n- The structure is clean and easy to scan; each question is motivated and sensible.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- The default recommendation assumes no dietary restrictions and doesn’t offer an alternative for vegetarians/vegans/gluten-free in the same “quick pick” spirit.\n- Focuses more on setting up a follow-up conversation than on helping a user who might want to decide immediately without replying.\n- Limited variety in the suggested default (only one specific combo); some users might want at least 2–3 “safe” go‑to options.\n\n---\n\nResponse B  \n**What it does well:**\n- Very user-focused and practical: organizes options by “mood” (classic, heavy, fancy, different), which maps naturally to how people think when ordering food.\n- Gives multiple concrete examples in each category with brief flavor descriptions, helping a user visualize what they’re getting (e.g., why Meat Lovers is heavy, why Margherita is light).\n- Includes a playful “Pizza Roulette” mini-decision-tree that helps someone quickly land on a choice with almost no prior thought.\n- Acknowledges diet preference (“Do you eat meat?”) and spicy/non-spicy preferences in the decision flow.\n- Offers to tailor further based on where they’re ordering from.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- Never settles on one or two clear “if you can’t decide, just get this” orders; it guides well but leaves final choice slightly open-ended.\n- Doesn’t mention gluten-free or vegan explicitly, and vegetarian is only implicit (Veggie Supreme in the roulette).\n- Somewhat verbose—could be shortened while retaining usefulness for someone who just wants a quick answer.\n\n---\n\nResponse C  \n**What it does well:**\n- Directly states that more information is needed and lists reasonable guiding questions (preferences, restrictions, mood, sharing).\n- Provides simple, easy “safe bet” options at the end (pepperoni or margherita), which do directly answer the question at a basic level.\n- Clear and concise; easy to read.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- Much less detailed and actionable than the other responses; it mostly restates the need for more info and gives high-level categories.\n- The “mood” mapping is very shallow (e.g., “Lighter: Veggie or Hawaiian,” which is debatable and oversimplified).\n- Doesn’t offer any nuanced guidance (no mention of crust style, size, budget, or specific combinations).\n- Feels generic and less helpful for someone truly undecided who wants more structured help.\n\n---\n\nResponse D  \n**What it does well:**\n- Offers an immediate, varied menu of suggestions by craving type: classic, meaty, veggie, adventurous, spicy. This lets almost anyone quickly see a couple of good choices.\n- Provides specific examples in each category (Margherita, Meat Lovers, Veggie Supreme, Hawaiian, BBQ Chicken, Buffalo Chicken).\n- Adds practical “pro tips” on crust, size, and sides, which are often relevant when ordering pizza.\n- Invites follow-up customization based on toppings, dietary preferences, or vendor, which is helpful if the user engages further.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- Like Response B, it doesn’t narrow down to a single strong go-to option when the user gives no further info; everything is conditional on “if you’re in the mood for…”.\n- Mentions “watching calories” for veggie pizza, which is a bit of an unsupported assumption and could be seen as off-target.\n- Doesn’t explicitly mention vegan or gluten-free options beyond a brief “gluten-free if needed” note—no examples of how that might change the choice.\n- Slightly chatty (“Haha,” emoji) which some users might find less professional, though that’s style rather than correctness.\n\n---\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

The \"Decision Tree\" style questions are relevant (budget, crowd size), but the standout feature is the \"Quick, safe, don't overthink it\" section. By suggesting a specific order (Half Pepperoni/Mushroom, Half Margherita), it actually solves the user's analysis paralysis rather than just listing options.\n- **Cons:** It places a small barrier to entry by listing the questions first, which might feel like \"homework\" to a user looking for quick inspiration.\n- **Summary:** A highly practical response that offers both a consultation and a specific default solution.\n\n**Response B**\n- **Pros:** This is the most engaging and user-friendly response. Instead of just asking for info, it categorizes common \"pizza moods\" (Classic, Value, Gourmet, Wildcards) with appetizing descriptions. The \"Pizza Roulette\" section at the end is creative and helpful; it gamifies the decision-process, allowing the user to make a choice without needing to type a follow-up reply.\n- **Cons:** None distinct; it handles the vague prompt excellently by providing a self-service menu of ideas.\n- **Summary:** The best response for helping the user make a decision immediately through fun and clear categorization.\n\n**Response C**\n- **Pros:** It is concise and covers the necessary clarifying questions (dietary restrictions, sharing). It offers a fallback \"safe bet\" recommendation at the end.\n- **Cons:** It is the least creative and helpful. The \"mood\" section is just a bulleted list without description handling, making it less appetizing or inspiring than the others. It feels somewhat robotic compared to the personality of B and D.\n- **Summary:** A functional, standard response that lacks the \"extra mile\" effort found in the others.\n\n**Response D**\n- **Pros:** The tone is friendly and casual (\"Haha, that's a tough one\"). It provides good categories similar to Response B and includes helpful \"Pro tips\" regarding crust and sides, which adds value to the ordering process.\n- **Cons:** The formatting is a bit dense (walls of text) compared to the cleaner structures of A and B. While good, it acts more like a general guide than a decision-making tool.\n- **Summary:** A solid, helpful response that provides good variety, though it requires the user to do a bit more reading to find their answer.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

It provides a clear default \"safe\" option with details like size, toppings, and crust, making it immediately useful even without further input. The offer to refine into a \"specific order\" adds value by promising personalization, and it's clear and logical in its flow.\n\n**What it does poorly:** The list of questions might feel overwhelming or interrogative for a simple query, potentially discouraging users who want a quick answer. It assumes a default scenario (1-3 people, no restrictions) without explaining why, and while accurate, it doesn't offer a broad range of inspirational options upfront, focusing more on data collection than exploration.\n\n### Evaluation of Response B\n**What it does well:** This response is engaging and user-friendly, categorizing suggestions by \"pizza mood\" (e.g., classic, heavy, fancy, different) with vivid descriptions that help users visualize and decide based on cravings. It includes a fun \"Pizza Roulette\" decision tree, which adds interactivity and makes the process enjoyable. The breakdown is complete with examples like specific toppings and flavor profiles, and it invites further details for refinement, enhancing usefulness. Clarity is strong due to the organized sections and bullet points.\n\n**What it does poorly:** It might be overly whimsical or assumptive about the user's \"vibe,\" which could feel subjective or less practical for straightforward users. While comprehensive in categories, it doesn't address practical aspects like dietary restrictions, group size, or budget upfront, potentially overlooking key constraints. The suggestions are accurate but could benefit from more neutral, fact-based pro tips.\n\n### Evaluation of Response C\n**What it does well:** The response is concise and straightforward, quickly acknowledging the lack of information and posing essential questions (e.g., likes, restrictions, mood, sharing) to guide the user. It offers basic mood-based suggestions with examples, providing a \"safe bet\" for pepperoni or margherita, which is clear and immediately actionable. This keeps things simple and accessible without overwhelming the user.\n\n**What it does poorly:** It's the least complete, with minimal depth in suggestions (e.g., no detailed descriptions of pizzas or additional categories like crust or sides). The mood-based options are brief and generic, reducing usefulness for users seeking inspiration or variety. It lacks engagement or fun elements, and while accurate, it doesn't provide as much value in helping users explore options independently.\n\n### Evaluation of Response D\n**What it does well:** This response is approachable and balanced, starting with a light tone (\"Haha\") to build rapport, then categorizing options by mood/craving with practical examples (e.g., toppings, styles). It includes \"pro tips\" on crust, size, and sides, adding completeness and usefulness. It asks relevant follow-up questions (favorites, dietary prefs, source) and references common chains, making it relatable and clear.\n\n**What it does poorly:** The casual tone might come across as too informal for some users, and while it covers a good range, the categories overlap somewhat with others (e.g., no unique standout like a decision game). It doesn't delve as deeply into specifics like group size or budget, and the suggestions, while accurate, could be more detailed in flavor profiles to enhance clarity and inspiration.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

Choose Based on Your \"Vibe\"\n*   **The Classic (Safe & Reliable):**\n    *   **Pepperoni:** The gold standard. Salty, savory, and greasy in the best way.\n    *   **Margherita:** Fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce. It’s lighter and lets the ingredients shine. Perfect if you don't want to feel heavy afterward.\n*   **The Heavy Hitter (Hungry & Indulgent):**\n    *   **Meat Lovers:** Pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon. If you are starving or want to fall into a food coma immediately after eating, this is the one.\n    *   **The Supreme / The Works:** You get the meat, but fresh veggies (peppers, onions, olives) provide a crunch that cuts through the grease.\n*   **The Wildcard (Something Different):**\n    *   **BBQ Chicken:** Sweet and tangy BBQ sauce base replaces the tomato. Often comes with red onions and cilantro.\n    *   **The Hawaiian:** Ham and Pineapple. The sweet and salty combo is actually delicious, despite the internet debates.\n    *   **Buffalo Chicken:** If you like spicy wings, this gives you that kick with a ranch or blue cheese drizzle.\n*   **The Gourmet (Fancy & White):**\n    *   **White Pizza (Pizza Bianca):** No tomato sauce. Usually features garlic, ricotta, mozzarella, and spinach. Creamy, rich, and sophisticated.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
